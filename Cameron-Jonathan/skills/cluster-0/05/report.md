## Summary
In this skill lesson I learnt how to flash and monitor the ESP32 using the hello_world example.

To make the onboard LED blink, I changed the project configuration menu (idf.py menuconfig) to choose the GPIO to blink.
I set it to #13 since that is what it matched up with on the Huzzah32. 

## Sketches and Photos
Here is a link to the video of it blinking:
