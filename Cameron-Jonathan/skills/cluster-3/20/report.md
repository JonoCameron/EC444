## Summary
This challenge was to set up a web server on the RPi, that could be accessed from both inside the local network and from a different network, for example on my phone, which wasn't connected to the local WiFi.

As you can see from the images included, I connected from both my phone running on cellular data and my laptop which was connected to the same network as the RPi.
