## Summary
This skill was to use the ADXL343 accelerometer to read acceleration in the x, y and z direction and to convert these acceleration values to the boards roll and pitch. The device was interfaced with through I2C, which meant reading registers of the accelerometer itself.

## Sketches and Photos
Here is a link to a demonstration on youtube:

I also depended heavily on the data sheet for the ADXL343.
