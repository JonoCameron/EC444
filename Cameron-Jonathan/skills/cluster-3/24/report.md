## Summary
This skill was to use PWM to light the LED to a target intensity set by the user, but to reach the intensity by stepping in discrete steps every 250ms. 

This will be a skill I go back to because in the interest of time I need to work on the Quest. At the moment it waits for user input then cycles up and down once before waiting for input again.
