## Summary
This skill was to process csv (tab-separated) data and put it into a database, and then to access the db from another program. With a bit of work, individual sensors could be accessed by their id number.

### Room for improvement
My db2.js just spits out the whole database raw to the terminal. This is not the only way that databases can be accessed (obviously, imagine how useless they would be if you had thousands of data points!!) MongoDB has a shell that can be used to access databases so you could access a single sensor.

This stack overflow article was a great help for parsing the csv file and put them into a mongo database.

This tutorial was really helpful starting out with mongodb, since I am new to it.
